        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This quick, fibre-rich veggie supper is filling and good for you too.
            Chickpeas are a great source of manganese, which is essential for healthy bone structure.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tbsp olive oil (or use the oil from your chargrilled veg, see below)</li>
            <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, finely sliced</li>
            <li>250g chargrilled Mediterranean veg (peppers and aubergines, if possible) from a jar, pot or deli counter, drained if in oil (you can use this oil in place of the olive oil) and roughly chopped</li>
            <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tbsp small capers</li>
            <li>2 tbsp raisins</li>
            <li>350g rigatoni, penne or another short pasta shape</li>
            <li>bunch basil leaves, picked</li>
            <li>parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), shaved, to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large pan and cook the onion for 8-10 mins until starting to caramelise (or for longer if you have time â€“ the sweeter the better). Add the garlic for the final 2 mins of cooking time.</li>
            <li>Tip in the mixed veg, tomatoes, capers and raisins. Season well and simmer, uncovered, for 10 mins, or until you have a rich sauce.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, boil the kettle. Pour the kettleful of water into a large pan with a little salt and bring back to the boil. Add the pasta and cook until tender with a little bite, then drain, reserving some of the pasta water. Tip the pasta into the sauce, adding a splash of pasta water if it needs loosening. Scatter with the basil leaves and parmesan, if you like, and serve straight from the pan.</li>
        </ol>
