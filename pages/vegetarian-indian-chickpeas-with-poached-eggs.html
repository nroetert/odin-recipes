        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp rapeseed oil</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
            <li>1 yellow pepper, deseeded and diced</li>
            <li>½ - 1 red chilli, deseeded and chopped</li>
            <li>½ bunch spring onions (about 5), tops and whites sliced but kept separate</li>
            <li>1 tsp cumin, plus a little extra to serve (optional)</li>
            <li>1 tsp coriander</li>
            <li>½ tsp turmeric</li>
            <li>3 tomatoes, cut into wedges</li>
            <li>⅓ pack coriander, chopped</li>
            <li>400g can chickpeas in water, drained but liquid reserved</li>
            <li>½ tsp reduced-salt bouillon powder (we used Marigold)</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a non-stick sauté pan, add the garlic, pepper, chilli and the whites from the spring onions, and fry for 5 mins over a medium-high heat. Meanwhile, put a large pan of water on to boil.</li>
            <li>Add the spices, tomatoes, most of the coriander and the chickpeas to the sauté pan and cook for 1-2 mins more. Stir in the bouillon powder and enough liquid from the chickpeas to moisten everything, and leave to simmer gently.</li>
            <li>Once the water is at a rolling boil, crack in your eggs and poach for 2 mins, then remove with a slotted spoon. Stir the spring onion tops into the chickpeas, then very lightly crush a few of the chickpeas with a fork or potato masher. Spoon the chickpea mixture onto plates, scatter with the reserved coriander and top with the eggs. Serve with an extra sprinkle of cumin, if you like.</li>
        </ol>
